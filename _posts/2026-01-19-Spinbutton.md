Spinbutton is a small, focused repo that delivers a highly customizable button for Home Assistant, with a spinner border that animates around the button. I built it to be simple, reusable, and easy to drop into small projects without pulling in a big UI framework.

It is intentionally minimal: a single, clear interaction pattern, small surface area, and clean styling you can adapt to your own HA dashboard.
