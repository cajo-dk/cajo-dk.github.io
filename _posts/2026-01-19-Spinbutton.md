Spinbutton is a small, focused repo that implements a classic UI control: a compact set of up/down buttons for incrementing numeric values. I built it to be simple, reusable, and easy to drop into small projects without pulling in a big UI framework.

It is intentionally minimal: a single, clear interaction pattern, small surface area, and clean styling you can adapt to your own app. If you need a lightweight number stepper, this is exactly that.
