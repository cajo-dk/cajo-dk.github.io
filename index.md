# Greetings 👋

I’m an IT architect by day and an incurable tinkerer by night. I spend my working hours thinking about structure, scale, and how technology can actually make life easier for people — and my late evenings experimenting with whatever caught my curiosity that week.

Most of the projects you’ll find here are the result of exactly that: late-night tinkering, half-finished ideas that turned into something useful, and “what if I just try this…” moments. Sometimes it’s automation, sometimes cloud or AI experiments, sometimes just scratching a technical itch.

I enjoy learning by building, breaking things (preferably in non-production environments), and sharing what I end up with along the way. If something here helps you, sparks an idea, or saves you a bit of time — mission accomplished.
